QCH (Quiz Creator Helper) is a web-based application designed to facilitate the creation and previewing of custom quizzes. The application offers a user-friendly interface divided into two main sections: the Quiz Creator and the Quiz Preview.

Quiz Creator Interface:
In the Quiz Creator interface, users can easily input questions and their corresponding answers. The interface provides fields for entering multiple-choice answers for each question. Users can designate the correct answer by selecting a checkbox provided next to each answer input field. Additionally, the interface allows users to add multiple questions to their quiz, enabling the creation of comprehensive quizzes tailored to specific topics or subjects.

Quiz Preview:
Upon completing the quiz creation process, users can preview their quiz in the Quiz Preview section. Here, each question is displayed along with its multiple-choice answers. However, to simulate the quiz-taking experience, the correct answers are hidden from view. This preview feature allows users to review the quiz and make any necessary adjustments before finalizing it.

Unique Quiz Generation:
When users are satisfied with their quiz setup, they can click the "Create Quiz" button. Upon doing so, the application generates a unique link for the quiz. This link serves as a direct access point to the created quiz, allowing users to share it with others or revisit it at a later time. The unique link is displayed to the user through an alert message, providing convenient access to the quiz.

With its intuitive interface and unique quiz generation feature, QCH provides users with a versatile solution for generating custom quizzes tailored to their needs.
